# Super Turbo Monster Puncher 3

This is an action-platformer punch-'em-up I wrote in HTML5/CSS/JS, reminiscent of the classic Mario Bros arcade game. Your goal in each level is to defeat all the enemies present, before the timer runs out, and without dying. Picking up coins will earn you points. Food will either restore lost health, or give you bonus points if the player's health is full.

"Deadly creeps are taking over the town! Are you a bad enough dude to punch them all?"
